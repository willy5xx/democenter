# Brand Logos

## How to Add Logos

Save your brand logo images to this directory with these exact filenames:

1. **Red Bull Logo:**
   - Filename: `redbull-logo.png`
   - Location: `/public/logos/redbull-logo.png`
   - Recommended size: 200-300px height, transparent background

2. **Huel Logo:**
   - Filename: `huel-logo.png`
   - Location: `/public/logos/huel-logo.png`
   - Recommended size: 200-300px height, transparent background

## Current Status

The images you provided have been configured in the tenant settings.

Simply save them with the correct filenames in this directory, and they will appear automatically in the dashboards!

## Notes

- Use PNG format with transparent backgrounds for best results
- SVG format is also supported (just change the extension in `tenants.json`)
- The logos will automatically scale to fit the header
- If a logo isn't found, the system gracefully hides the image element
