Interactive camera dashboard for showcasing vendVision capabilities. Set up your camera streaming in minutes!

---

## 🎯 For Salespeople - Quick Reference

**First Time Setup (one time only):**
```bash
./setup-demo.sh          # Enter camera IP, username, password when prompted
./verify-setup.sh        # Check everything is configured
./start-vendvision.sh    # Start the demo
```

**Every Other Time:**
```bash
./start-vendvision.sh    # Just run this!
```

**Dashboard:** http://localhost:5173  
**If camera doesn't work:** See the [troubleshooting section](#-troubleshooting) below

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **macOS or Linux** (Windows not currently supported)
- **Node.js v18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **OBS Studio** (for Zoom/Teams demos) - [Download here](https://obsproject.com/) - The setup script will configure it automatically
- **Docker Desktop** (optional, for container-based streaming) - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/vendvision-demo-center.git
cd vendvision-demo-center
```

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
./setup-demo.sh
```

This will:
- Install all dependencies (backend + frontend)
- Download the streaming server (go2rtc)
- **Ask for your Tapo Camera IP & credentials**
- Configure OBS for Zoom virtual camera (for demo presentations)

### 3. Verify Setup (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
./verify-setup.sh
```

This checks that everything is configured correctly before starting.

### 4. Start the Demo Center

```bash
./start-vendvision.sh
```

That's it! The dashboard will open at **http://localhost:5173**

### 5. Verify Camera Connection

After starting, check that the camera stream is working:

1. Open http://localhost:1984 (go2rtc admin)
2. You should see streams named `site1_main` and `site1_dewarped`
3. Click on `site1_dewarped` to verify the video feed
4. If you see video here but not in the dashboard, refresh the dashboard page

## 📍 What You'll See

| URL / App | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| http://localhost:5173 | Main Dashboard |
| http://localhost:5173/presentation | Full-screen presentation mode |
| http://localhost:5173/admin/calibrate | Machine calibration tool |
| http://localhost:1984 | go2rtc admin (streaming) |
| http://localhost:3001 | Backend API |
| OBS Studio | Virtual camera for Zoom (launches automatically) |

---

## 🔧 Daily Usage

Just run:
```bash
./start-vendvision.sh
```

To stop everything, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

---

## 🎥 OBS Virtual Camera (For Zoom/Teams Demos)

OBS Studio creates a virtual camera that lets you share your vendVision dashboard professionally in Zoom/Teams calls - appearing as your webcam feed instead of a screen share.

**The setup script configures OBS automatically.** If you skipped it or need to reconfigure:

```bash
./setup-obs.sh
```

When you run `./start-vendvision.sh`, OBS will launch automatically. Just click **"Start Virtual Camera"** in OBS, then select "OBS Virtual Camera" in your Zoom video settings.

See `docs/ZOOM_VIRTUAL_CAMERA_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

---

## 📹 Camera Support

### Tapo C510W (Recommended)
The setup wizard will ask for:
- Camera IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
- Username (usually `admin`)
- Password (your camera password)

### Other RTSP Cameras
Edit `go2rtc.yaml` manually:
```yaml
streams:
  camera1: rtsp://username:password@ip:554/stream1
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Camera not connecting (404 error)?

**This is the most common issue!** If you see "404" errors in the browser console:

1. **Check if go2rtc is running:**
   ```bash
   # Open http://localhost:1984 in your browser
   # You should see the go2rtc admin interface
   ```

2. **Verify stream names match:**
   ```bash
   # Look in go2rtc.yaml - you should see:
   #   site1_main:
   #   site1_dewarped:
   # 
   # If you see just "main:" and "dewarped:" (no site1_ prefix),
   # regenerate the config:
   cd backend
   node scripts/generate-go2rtc-config.js
   cd ..
   
   # Then restart go2rtc:
   pkill go2rtc
   ./go2rtc -config go2rtc.yaml &
   ```

3. **Test the stream directly:**
   - Go to http://localhost:1984
   - Click on `site1_dewarped` stream
   - If video shows here but not in dashboard, refresh the dashboard

### Camera credentials wrong?
1. Edit the database directly or re-run setup:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/setup-wizard.js
   ```
2. This will update your camera credentials and regenerate go2rtc.yaml

### go2rtc won't start?
```bash
# Check if port 1984 is in use
lsof -i :1984

# Kill any existing go2rtc process
pkill go2rtc

# Start it again
./start-vendvision.sh
```

### Backend errors?
```bash
cd backend
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```
